    <h3 id="About">About Me</h3>
    <p>Name: Chulathep Silapanuntakul</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Standpoint:<br> &ensp; One will succumb to illness one day. I view medicine as a way to help mitigate one‚Äôs pain and suffering when that day comes. This particular view of mine has developed as a result of being exposed, and latterly, keen observation and helping in my part in my family‚Äôs routine medical outreach programmes in the rural of Thailand ‚Äì ever since I was young. On the basis of compassion for others fellow humans and oneself, along with rigorous training and relentless self-improvement, I believe that I have the potential as an aspiring fit for the medical programme at The Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. I esteem to join the medical profession, as one of many, as a part of the team to help to alleviate the people‚Äôs vexation.</p>
    <p>Place of Origin: Bangkok, Thailand</p>

    <h3>A Tiny Bit About Me:)</h3>

He is mostly known from his comepetition in the national television programme 'Genwit Presented by Bangchak Group' which was live on Workpoint Entertainment's Channel as he was nominated as a representative of Suankularb Wittayalai, winning a bronze medal there. At Suankularb, Chulathep was the elected President of Technology and Development Club in 2023, managing and promoting interest, awareness and research orienting towards the discipline for both inside and outside the organization. Prior to being promoted, he also hosted the club‚Äôs podcast. Moreover, he was the gold medalist for the Singapore-Thailand Science Immersion Programme 2023 hosted by the Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore. He is the founder and the organizer of the ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏°, a project that aims to provide donated paper and fabric bags, reusing them for patients-in-need in rural and urban hospitals alike.
