	<p>Subject: A Reattempt on Water Fasting</p>
	<p> Hello Folks,</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
I intitially was going to write to you about the upcomming misfortunate events and behind the scene of the 23rd something School Exhibition, the name of the school is redacted here for my fear of lawsuits. I did thought, then I asked myself, who cares? So with my fingertips filled with narcissism, I decided to write about myself, hurrah. The writting began thusly.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
I have tried some 5 days ago, for it went for 2 and a half days, 60 hours or something. Originally, I planned for 3 days non stop, however, living one's life to make other things that you are eating like a regular person of the post industial society requries the socially elected acceptable 3 meals per day. Some would scream ferouciously at you for eating 2 meals a day or skipping breakfast. We are so propagandized by the godforbid slogan of the "breakfast is the most important thing of the day" scheme.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
I think I am going to reattempt for a 72 hours water fasting with nothing but water, and some minnerals. After the last course of water-fasting, I took up food and water as a socially accepted being would, and for the last two days, I did excercise for building one's muscle.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
Obviously, since the blog will be formatted as a letter‚Äîmore specifically, the Thai style‚Äîthe international business style I refuse to adopt. The time and date will not reflect when it is posted but when I finish writing. Hence, a letter. You see there? I am using this little letter gimmick to my advantage. Huzzah for me! Formatting one's writing from the Notes app to HTML on an iPad or, God forbid, a phone, is a living nightmare. But one must persevere.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
Now, less about me and more about knowleadege to fill your noggin. From <i><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319835#summary">Medical News Today, 2023</a></i> "Water fasting is when a person eats no food and drinks only water. It has various uses, including to lose weight, for spiritual or religious reasons, or to try and combat particular health problems."  Now, that is enough information for you today. So basically, when you consume something, you take in calorie to survive, if you eat too much, you gain fat. If you eat less, you loose fat. 
</p>
      
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
Now it has something to do with ketosis but I am not a qualified human being to explain it to you. I am barely a human! So watch this:...

Trust him, he is a doctor, I am not. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">	
Now, one would ask with waterfasting, is one valuing too much beauty rather than oneself's health? Frankly?... Yes. But it might as well help with one's health too. <i><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6326845/">Mitchell, et al.'s 2020</a></i> said that "Daily fasting improves health and survival in male mice independent of diet composition and calories." Or at least that is the title of his paper. "MF and CR regimes enhanced longevity regardless of diet composition, which alone had no significant impact within feeding regimens.", and that is good enough for me. But one must also must be aware of the risks too, which again, watch the goddamn videos. Balance your health at your own risk, I am not making no one do this. And please do not follow this non medical advice. Think about it for yourself. A foot not I do really want to add for this is the newsroom announcement I just from the American Heart Association, so that is someone notable, who said that: "8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death". Circa 2024, FYI.

So thats the end of it, wish me to break a leg or something, and not to break into a tub of margarine. Thanks.
