    <h4 id="ELDERLY">First and Corresponding Author for the 
paper titled ‘Use of Social Media for 
Health Promotion among the Elderly in 
Thailand’ (2023)</h4>
    <p>
&emsp;After witnessing the behaviour of the NCD 
patients at both the HPHs and the Hospitals from 
my shadowing and volunteerism, it had sparked my interest about 
Gerontology and other aspects of health. In relation to my online 
promotion of the ถุงเราให้ยืม Project which targets the adults and elderly, I have done the study on the 
‘Use of Social Media for Health Promotion among the Elderly in Thailand’- which I found that 
social media could be an effective tool for health promotion. I was the first and corresponding 
author and presented it at an International Conference in Singapore. This had further developed 
my skills in research and oral presentation at an international level.

    <h4 id="COLIFORM"> Project Manager and Corresponding Author ‘Study of food sanitation conditions and coliform 
bacteria contamination of food utensils in the school canteen with the SI-2 test kit: A case study 
of a large high school in Bangkok’ (2024)</h4>
    <p>
&emsp;As I became more interested at home, I decided to investigate our school's food safety and sanitation 
conditions, particularly focusing on coliform bacteria contamination in food contact utensils. Our 
findings revealed that the general eating areas and food preparation sections met high sanitation 
standards while those for containers, equipment, 
and waste management were inadequate and the 
coliform contamination of food utensils was 
observed. Our research team recommended the 
school as such and presented to the EPLUS 
International symposium at our school.
These experiences have not only sharpened my leadership, 
collaborating, planning, coordinating, analytical abilities, data 
management and my practice in empirical research but also 
fuelled my passion for evidence-based medicine and health 
advocacy.
