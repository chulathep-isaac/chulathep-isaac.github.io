    <h1>M4 Semester II</h1>
    <p>Here is the notes I make as I am going through M4 semester II at the Suankularb Wittayalai School English Program (here we call it EPLUS). I will try to update this daily but no promises ok?
    Please also excuse my hand writting, I know it is quite a horrible one but I am trying to work on it :)
    </p>
    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
    <p>This subject is taught by Lect. Nattarika Rodsatid. She is quite a fun teacher herself. At first I am not quite interested in Astronomy, the subject as much as I do now. She does makes class fun. I do really want to share the PDF she gave us with you but I do need her permission first for the coppyrights is hers.
    <hr> The content of the second semester includes Big Bang Theory.</p>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>This subject is taught by Lect. Niruth Prombutr, Ph.D. He is very professional and caring teacher, for changing my mind to be ok with Physics is hard but making me do well with Physics is harder. His class is ofcoures still challenging. These are the notes I take in class but some other matterials is in his name. The link below is to his website.
    <hr> The content of the second semester for the Physics Notes includes Work and Energy, Momentum, Circular Motion, and Rotational Motion. He has added the Rotational Motion from the national standard syllabus since it is in our national entrance exam for engineering. And for the SIA II the notes contents of the notes include Electricity and Modern Physics.</p>
