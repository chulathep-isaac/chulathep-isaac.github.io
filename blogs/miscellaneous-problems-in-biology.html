      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This blog was created to log interesting and "clever" problems in Biology that can be solved using a high-school (ish) level of knowledge.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in the <a href="../portal.html">all blogs</a> page feel free to use the <b>Ctrl + F</b> to find the problem you want to.</p>
      <p>Have fun browsing :></p>

            <p>A medical student wants cloned the promotor of plasmid <b>pBR322</b> of <i>Escherichia coli</i> which has the origin of replication (ori). He later cultured two sets the bacteria with <b>1) ampicilin and 2) tetracycline</b> as demonstrated in the table. The lab result however was unfortunately messed up later on.</p>

            <p>Which of the lab result is probably the correct one?</p>

              <p>As there is no official answer published, the solution that will be given is from the synthesis of Camp II POSN Bio students (now abbreviated as "CIIPB").</p>
              <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBR322#/media/File:PBR322.svg" />
              <p>Some of the CIIPB argued that the answer should be <b>A</b> deducing from the result of the restiction enzyme culture.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I think that the answer should be <b>E</b> with the following resoning:</p>
              <p>If you follow the diagram given above, and as mentioned in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBR322#cite_note-seq-3">Wikipedia article</a>:
                "There are two sites for restriction enzymes HindIII and ClaI within the promoter of the TetR gene."
                Thus, the vector of the arrow is the direction which the transcription will happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem stated that we want the promoter of the plasmid labelled "ori" which in the solution diagram is read from >3000 to >2000 PstI should thus be used since we know that the promoter is located between -70 base pair before the start codon.
              </p>
              <p>From the deduction using the restriction enzyme, the answer should, hence, be <b>E</b>.</p>
              <p>Note: This is not an official answer!</p>
