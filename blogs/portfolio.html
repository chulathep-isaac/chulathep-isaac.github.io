    <h3 id="preamble"> Preamble </h3><hr>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;From an early age, growing up in a family whose background is in Public Health, especially through medical outreach programs in rural Thailand, I was fortunate to witness firsthand the importance of providing care to those in need in the countryside. These experiences -being exposed to basic rural medicine, especially the one along these few recent years, have gradually nurtured and bring forth my passion for medicine and strengthened my desire to contribute to the well-being of others. <br>
&emsp;This portfolio represents my efforts and commitment to pursuing a career in medicine. Whether through academic challenges and competition, the ‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏° project and other volunteer works, or the research projects, I have tried to build a solid foundation in the sciences and cultivate a mindset of empathy and service- though I know that this is barely scratching the surface of medicine, and thusly, becoming a medical student. Each experience I have cultivated, both inside and outside the classroom, has deepened my understanding that medicine is not only about knowledge but also about compassion and a dedication to lifelong learning on the basis of hard work.<br>
&emsp;I hope that this portfolio will reflect more than just my achievements. I want it to convey who I am as a multi-dimensional person‚Äîthe values I hold, the lessons I have learned, and the passion I bring to this field. Rather than simply being a list of accomplishments, I hope it illustrates my commitment to becoming a compassionate, capable of medical education, and finally a well-rounded medical professional.<br>
&emsp;As I apply to the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, I am excited to continue learning, growing, and facing new challenges at this world class medical school. I look forward to the opportunity to further develop myself and contribute meaningfully to the healthcare community.<br><br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Chulathep Silapanuntakul.

      <h4 id="NUS">Achieved ‚ÄòIndividual Gold‚Äô, and ‚ÄòTeam Gold‚Äô by the National University of Singapore for the outstanding performance in Singapore-Thailand Science Immersion Programme 2023 Science Challenge. (8th May 2023 ‚Äì 13th May 2023)</h4>
      <p>&emsp;After being selected to attend the Singapore-Thailand Science Immersion Programme 2023, organized by the prestigious Faculty of Science at the National University of Singapore, I achieved gold medals in both the Team and Individual categories of the Science Challenge held at the end of the rigorous programme held during 8th May 2023 ‚Äì 13th May 2023. Throughout the week, through my efforts, I was astutely able to successfully grasped complex topics in STEM, ranging from nanotechnologies to probabilities, all taught in English by leading university professors in their fields. This experience not only broadened my academic horizons but also reinforced my belief in a non-competitive learning environment. During the camp, I partially take it as my responsibility to help others who struggle with the materials after the lectures.<br>
&emsp;By helping and tutoring other students, I fostered collaboration among peers, believing that shared learning leads to collective growth‚Äîa mindset that aligns with the spirit of medical education. I see challenges as opportunities to improve and believe that success is driven by effort and openness to feedback. I had held this as a great learning point in my life, not only for the fact that it opens my experience to look forward to the bigger world of academics with the community helping and fostering each other‚Äôs but also to establish my confidence through persistence in learning.<br>

      <h4 id="GENWIT">Attained the Semi-finalists Stage (Last 4 Teams) as Team Player of the Science Gameshow ‚ÄòGenwit ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏à‡∏â‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏∏‡πå‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà Presented by Bangchak Group‚Äô on Workpoint Entertainment (5th April - 24 June 2024)</h4>
      <p>
&emsp;After conscientious selections and interviews, I was recruited to represent my school in the STEM game show "Genwit Presented by Bangchak Group", aired on Workpoint TV. The game challenges were unknown to the contestants prior to the game and thus required adaptability, agile thinking, and the integration of all discipline of science and mathematics. Although we are from the same school, most of us had barely known others prior to the first tape. As the team leader, I had to be both decisive and democratic, trusting my other teammate of 4's expertise while remaining confident in my own, particularly in Biology which the basis of my information is mostly built on my experience form the POSN Biology camp. Once we advance to the next round, we hold a meeting to plan and prepare, as the challenges often come unexpectedly and plan for the conditions that the next challenges may occur. Conducting research not only boosts our confidence but also helps us better understand the dynamics of the opposing team. When challenges fell outside my field, I stepped back, letting the subject expert take the lead to be adaptive based on facts as much as possible, embodying the spirit of teamwork and leadership.<br>
&emsp;Effective communication was crucially required, both in collaborating with my team and explaining complex scientific concepts to a general audience - a vital skill for any medical professional. My team and I reached the semifinals, surpassing two other school teams. We remained professional and respectful of our highly skilled peers throughout, as they are also highly skilled in their own fields. During filming and while in the public eye, we had to maintain our composure under scrutiny, knowing that our actions could be misinterpreted. Although there were some particular online judgments toward our team, I saw them as opportunities to grow, using the feedback for self-improvement - considering some of them while taking them professionally. Overall, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I am proud of.<br>
