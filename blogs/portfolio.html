    <h2 id="#preamble"> Preamble </h2>
    <pre style="text-align: justify;">
      From an early age, growing up in a family whose background is in Public Health, especially through medical outreach programs in rural Thailand, I was fortunate to witness firsthand the importance of providing care to those in need in the countryside. These experiences -being exposed to basic rural medicine, especially the one along these few recent years, have gradually nurtured and bring forth my passion for medicine and strengthened my desire to contribute to the well-being of others.
This portfolio represents my efforts and commitment to pursuing a career in medicine. Whether through academic challenges and competition, the ถุงเราให้ยืม project and other volunteer works, or the research projects, I have tried to build a solid foundation in the sciences and cultivate a mindset of empathy and service- though I know that this is barely scratching the surface of medicine, and thusly, becoming a medical student. Each experience I have cultivated, both inside and outside the classroom, has deepened my understanding that medicine is not only about knowledge but also about compassion and a dedication to lifelong learning on the basis of hard work.
I hope that this portfolio will reflect more than just my achievements. I want it to convey who I am as a multi-dimensional person—the values I hold, the lessons I have learned, and the passion I bring to this field. Rather than simply being a list of accomplishments, I hope it illustrates my commitment to becoming a compassionate, capable of medical education, and finally a well-rounded medical professional.
As I apply to the Faculty of Medicine at Khon Kean University, I am excited to continue learning, growing, and facing new challenges at this world class medical school. I look forward to the opportunity to further develop myself and contribute meaningfully to the healthcare community.
Sincerely yours,
Chulathep Silapanuntakul.
