    <h3 id="preamble"> Preamble </h3><hr>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;From an early age, growing up in a family whose background is in Public Health, especially through medical outreach programs in rural Thailand, I was fortunate to witness firsthand the importance of providing care to those in need in the countryside. These experiences -being exposed to basic rural medicine, especially the one along these few recent years, have gradually nurtured and bring forth my passion for medicine and strengthened my desire to contribute to the well-being of others. <br>
&emsp;This portfolio represents my efforts and commitment to pursuing a career in medicine. Whether through academic challenges and competition, the ‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏° project and other volunteer works, or the research projects, I have tried to build a solid foundation in the sciences and cultivate a mindset of empathy and service- though I know that this is barely scratching the surface of medicine, and thusly, becoming a medical student. Each experience I have cultivated, both inside and outside the classroom, has deepened my understanding that medicine is not only about knowledge but also about compassion and a dedication to lifelong learning on the basis of hard work.<br>
&emsp;I hope that this portfolio will reflect more than just my achievements. I want it to convey who I am as a multi-dimensional person‚Äîthe values I hold, the lessons I have learned, and the passion I bring to this field. Rather than simply being a list of accomplishments, I hope it illustrates my commitment to becoming a compassionate, capable of medical education, and finally a well-rounded medical professional.<br>
&emsp;As I apply to the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, I am excited to continue learning, growing, and facing new challenges at this world class medical school. I look forward to the opportunity to further develop myself and contribute meaningfully to the healthcare community.<br><br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Chulathep Silapanuntakul.

      <h4 id="NUS">Achieved ‚ÄòIndividual Gold‚Äô, and ‚ÄòTeam Gold‚Äô by the National University of Singapore for the outstanding performance in Singapore-Thailand Science Immersion Programme 2023 Science Challenge. (8th May 2023 ‚Äì 13th May 2023)</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;After being selected to attend the Singapore-Thailand Science Immersion Programme 2023, organized by the prestigious Faculty of Science at the National University of Singapore, I achieved gold medals in both the Team and Individual categories of the Science Challenge held at the end of the rigorous programme held during 8th May 2023 ‚Äì 13th May 2023. Throughout the week, through my efforts, I was astutely able to successfully grasped complex topics in STEM, ranging from nanotechnologies to probabilities, all taught in English by leading university professors in their fields. This experience not only broadened my academic horizons but also reinforced my belief in a non-competitive learning environment. During the camp, I partially take it as my responsibility to help others who struggle with the materials after the lectures.<br>
&emsp;By helping and tutoring other students, I fostered collaboration among peers, believing that shared learning leads to collective growth‚Äîa mindset that aligns with the spirit of medical education. I see challenges as opportunities to improve and believe that success is driven by effort and openness to feedback. I had held this as a great learning point in my life, not only for the fact that it opens my experience to look forward to the bigger world of academics with the community helping and fostering each other‚Äôs but also to establish my confidence through persistence in learning.<br>

      <h4 id="GENWIT">Attained the Semi-finalists Stage (Last 4 Teams) as Team Player of the Science Gameshow ‚ÄòGenwit ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏à‡∏â‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏∏‡πå‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà Presented by Bangchak Group‚Äô on Workpoint Entertainment (5th April - 24 June 2024)</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;After conscientious selections and interviews, I was recruited to represent my school in the STEM game show "Genwit Presented by Bangchak Group", aired on Workpoint TV. The game challenges were unknown to the contestants prior to the game and thus required adaptability, agile thinking, and the integration of all discipline of science and mathematics. Although we are from the same school, most of us had barely known others prior to the first tape. As the team leader, I had to be both decisive and democratic, trusting my other teammate of 4's expertise while remaining confident in my own, particularly in Biology which the basis of my information is mostly built on my experience form the POSN Biology camp. Once we advance to the next round, we hold a meeting to plan and prepare, as the challenges often come unexpectedly and plan for the conditions that the next challenges may occur. Conducting research not only boosts our confidence but also helps us better understand the dynamics of the opposing team. When challenges fell outside my field, I stepped back, letting the subject expert take the lead to be adaptive based on facts as much as possible, embodying the spirit of teamwork and leadership.<br>
&emsp;Effective communication was crucially required, both in collaborating with my team and explaining complex scientific concepts to a general audience - a vital skill for any medical professional. My team and I reached the semifinals, surpassing two other school teams. We remained professional and respectful of our highly skilled peers throughout, as they are also highly skilled in their own fields. During filming and while in the public eye, we had to maintain our composure under scrutiny, knowing that our actions could be misinterpreted. Although there were some particular online judgments toward our team, I saw them as opportunities to grow, using the feedback for self-improvement - considering some of them while taking them professionally. Overall, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I am proud of.<br>

      <h4 id="POSN">Completed the Second POSN Biology Olympiad Camp of the Bangkok POSN Centre at Debsirin School (Camp II & I: 1st -18th March 2023 & 2nd -19th October 2024)</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;After a year of diligent effort, I was accepted into the 23rd POSN Biology Olympiad Camp in 2023. Through learning with college professors with diverse styles, propelled me to adapt to being more active in my learning, having had absorbed quickly the condensed curriculum that compresses three years of high school biology into just three weeks. With endeavour in mind, in the camps, we helped each other‚Äôs in the studying, sharing short notes, mock exams and helping with unfamiliar materials. This surrounding teamwork and collaborative environment pleasantly surprised me which I courteously adapted and changed to ever since, which changed my whole perspective for me. This is since that there is always a bigger fish in the sea, whether they are competitors at the National or the International Olympiad which if we pass the camp, we have to compete with anyhow ‚Äì simply a more benefit for all and made us all more fit for the challenges ahead.<br>
&emsp;Involving myself deeply with the subject of Biology, the closest one could get to experience when compared to studying medicine at a secondary school level, also made me more confident that I prefer schooling in the subject. This made me sure that I will also be able to study proficiently in medicine, given all my effort that I am willing to give to medicine.<br>

      <h3 id="MEDCOMPETITION">Medical and Medical Related Competitions</h3>
&emsp;Over the years, I have had the privilege, whether nominated by the school or self-pursued, to compete in many a competition, including medical and medical related ones in national, international and city levels. These are the opportunities not only practice myself in the competitions but to also honed ability to respond to critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and perseverance. As is showed below, these are some of the medical and medical related competitions which I had participated in and secured some of the winnings.<hr>
      
      <h4 id="CUDAC">Secured the Semi-final round of the Chulalongkorn University Dental Academic Competition, 2024 hosted by the Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University.</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;Nominated by my school during the filming of ‚ÄòGenwit,‚Äô my strong teamwork and academic abilities in Biology allowed me to participate as a team member in this competition. The second round of the tournament, known as the 'Bell Ringing Examination,' required effective communication due to its format, which combined calculations with scientific theory, primarily integrating Chemistry and Biology. My friend and I each took on our respective roles in these parts. Alongside these skills, our ability to manage time effectively played a crucial role. This ultimately led us to secure a spot in the semi-finalist round. Overall, I see this experience not only as an academic achievement but also as an opportunity to practice my communication and teamwork skills in an academic setting.

      <h4 id="SIMSAT">Placed in the Top 70th Percentile in Siriraj Mathematical and Science Aptitude Test 2024 held by Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;Self-pursued by my teammates and I, we were able to be placed on the top 70th percentile of more than 300 teams competing with each other‚Äôs. The test was segmented into Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics and the team was allowed with only 3 people per group which our effective partition of the work, effective management along with time management were crucial for our place on the 70th percentile. Although this was not the first time I had personally tried to compete in this tournament, this proved to me that the diligent effort that I have put in my study and the diligent undertaking needed made me improved in over a year and are the keys in the journey to success in the long-term.

    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;Since both of these are medical and medical related competitions, these allow me to view the coming up problems and apply the knowledge I already have in Biology to a side of which I prospect as a medical student more. These tourneys had also whetted my abilities to be more agile in the academic side of things too. In general, these experience not only gave me these awards but also gave me in the long run the ability to be dextrous in applying the knowledge which I already have in hand, a quality which I think that is crucial in medicine at large.<br>
&emsp;Amid successes, failure is natural. I have experienced failure as well. However, I believe it is crucial to manage, understand, adapt, and let not the failure hinder improvement or induce fear. When one fails, one must not fail to learn from one‚Äôs mistakes and use them as stepping stones for one‚Äôs growth. In summary, if success was to be plotted on a graph, I believe that a sustainable and steady increase is more important than explosive and abrupt growth. The competitions listed below are some of the examples of those in which I have participated.<br>

      <h4 id="PCPM">Participated in the Pitching Challenge for solving Physically Challenged and Mental Health Problems (PCPM) hosted by IFMSA Thailand</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;I had previously participated in the Pitching Challenge for solving Physically Challenged and Mental Health Problems (PCPM) hosted by IFMSA Thailand ‚Äì a similar style of competitions to the hackathons. This had kickstarted my keen interest in empathizing with the target audience of the problems and using technologies to solve them. The project was entitled ‚ÄòUse of new nicotine patch in the scrotal area‚Äô as crazy as it may sound. The core idea was to apply the nicotine patch to the scrotal area of men. Although the idea may be impractical and albeit weird in that sense, this has inspired me to be more creative in the sciences and solve problems outside the box. I have improved much since then but I am proud of it as my starting point in these kinds of competitions.

      <h4 id="SAMSUNG">Qualified for the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2023 presented by Samsung and the Office of the Basic Education Commission</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;After being invited into a team, with my background interest in gerontology, we decided to solve the problem about the aging population in Thailand in that respective area. In the duration of the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow programme, we were encouraged to use and were thought about design thinking ‚Äì a method to better solve the core of a problem by empathizing with the people in that situation. We applied that into use in the elderly in Thailand in the city who often lacks the community and the socialization, detrimental to their mental health, and most importantly caretakers. Thus, our team purposed and pitched for the development of an application which would help to connect caretakers to the elderly. I believe that doing research will not only help solving the core of a problem but also help to empathise them as not just a problem but there is a human with in that problem. Although my team and I were just competitors in this challenge, I had however gained far more expected a perspective for better solving problems, empathising and understanding the customer targets of the problems.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;After meticulous selection from more than 200 competitor teams, my team and I was able to reach the top 10 finalist of the HACK Youth 2023 Hackathon Competition. The competition let us collaborate to rapidly engineer a solution for a problem of presenting a concept for improving the equality of access to healthcare for the people in the rural area, especially of Thailand. Continuous update of technology trends and new existing innovations is cardinal in these kind competition ‚Äì and as I believe to be so, for the medical education and practice I aim to be in too. We presented a concept of a more practical and economical kind of ambulance that could be stationed in the Heath Promoting Hospitals around Thailand along with installations of telemedical equipment and application which could be realistically put into place given the funding. After we had collaboratively team-worked said solution, it was then presented orally to the judges which our effective oral communication in English was required for the situation. Though not the first attempt of mine at this kind of competition, I am still proud to get to be the top 10 finalist

      <h4 id="SKTD">Elected and Served as President for Technology and Development Club, Suankularb Wittayalai School, 2023</h4>
      <p>&emsp;Along with the class leadership, I joined the Technology and
Development Club to satisfy my interest in technology and was later
elected to serve as President for a one-year term. The club's primary
mission was to promote technology literacy among students and the
school community. Prior to presidency, I was the host of the club
podcast, which honed my ability to actively listen and guide
dynamic conversations, fostering clear communication -
especially during the school‚Äôs council election. And when I assume
the presidency, I coordinated several club
activities, including participating in school-wide
events like Activity Day and Science Week. Using
leadership, organizational skills, and
teamwork, I ensured efficient workflows and
clear communication within the club. Quick
decision-making and problem-solving were unforeseen challenges which I was able to utilise. And now, as president emeritus, I act as a
mentor, helping to recommend and understand the current generation using my past experience
including failure which I embrace as my learning opportunity, the experiences I pass on. Overall, I
view my experience in this club as very meaningful for me and I owe my growth as an effective leader
and as a person from it.

    <h4 id="MONGOLIA">Selected as the City‚Äôs Representative Delegation for SisterCities Youth Exchange 2024, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia by 
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration</h4>
      <p>
&emsp;After intense selection of more than 200 people, I was 
picked as one of 10 students to represent the city of Bangkok in 
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Out of many, I picked Mongolia as I saw it 
as a rare opportunity to experience and understand a different 
culture. I was able to manage a constructive exchange of culture 
internationally with the English language ‚Äì including a speech 
to the Head of the Governor‚Äôs office. I also had a near-death 
experience of my group falling from a horse back 
due to a terrible hail storm, which required 
immediate first aid. I have to stay calm, utilised my 
first aid training and territorial defence training to 
help others, Thais and foreigners and myself in an 
emergency. This has highlighted the importance 
of staying calm, medical knowledge and make 
me appreciate being alive in the moment.

    <h3 id="VOLUNTEERISM">Medical Shadowing and Volunteerism</h3>
    <h4 id="RURAL"></h4>
    <p>&emsp;Coming from a family deeply rooted in Public Health, with 
my father serving as an Associate Professor at Mahidol 
University, I have had the privilege of being exposed to 
healthcare outreach programs from a young age. Following in 
the footsteps of His and Her Majesties‚Äô Royal Projects, my 
family has been involved in initiatives supported by the Royal 
Irrigation Department. Initially, I accompanied these trips as 
an observer, but over time, I began 
contributing in small yet meaningful ways. 
As I grew older, I took on roles such as 
record-keeping, assisting with weighing 
healthcare recipients, and helping wherever 
I could‚Äîwhether it was distributing water or 
offering support to the medical team. I often 
worked alongside healthcare professionals 
like Assoc. Prof. Phitaya Charupoonphol, M.D., and others, 
gaining a deeper understanding of their empathetic approach 
to patient care.<br>
&emsp;These outreach efforts took place in rural areas that were 
often hard to access and lacked many of the public amenities, which I found myself easily 
adapting to these environments. Through these experiences, the patients were predominantly 
elderly, with NCDs and muscle ache due to demanding works. I also came to appreciate the 
role of local healthcare volunteers and the Health Promoting Hospital‚Äôs (HPHs) in supporting 
bedridden, elderly, and chronically ill patients. Structed me most was how the doctors sought 
to minimise medication use, focusing on health education, preventive care, and acupuncture to 
relieve pain, instead. This approach highlights to me the importance of integrating 
treatment with health promotion, prevention, and rehabilitation, I want to practice in the 
future. This hands-on exposure was the spark that ignited my passion for medicine. Though 
my contributions have been small thus far, they have deepened my desire to pursue a career 
where I can make a significant impact on people‚Äôs lives through healthcare.</p>

    <h4 id="SHADOW">Shadowed in doctors and other healthcare professionals at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
Taksin Hospital, Bangkok, and a Health Promoting Hospital (HPH) in Nakhon Pathom. </h4>
      <p>
&emsp;As I have realised my interest in embarking on a career in 
medicine after years of following the outreach mobile clinic, I had 
chosen to self-pursue it further by requesting these hospitals and 
institutions to have a more complete view of medicine as a 
profession. With the doctor‚Äôs and patient‚Äôs permission, I was able to 
shadow many a surgeon, radiation-oncologist, specialist and other 
professionals at the NCI- a tertiary hospital. I gain valuable insights 
into the dynamics of the Departments working together to help 
a patient. While shadowing a GI surgeon, a Siriraj alumnus, Dr. 
Kitinat Timudom, I observed him manage a heavy workload‚Äî
including a three-hour total colectomy and four colonoscopies‚Äîyet 
he still cared deeply for his patients by compassionately delivering 
difficult news to a stage 4 cancer patient. This experience showed 
me how dedicated doctors need to be. <br>
&emsp;At Taksin Hospital‚Äôs eye clinic, I was impressed by healthcare 
professionals who, despite limited resources and an overworked 
environment, remained dedicated to patient care through 
resourcefulness and quick thinking. While the Health Promoting 
Hospital, I observed the doctor‚Äôs patience and understanding for 
guide the patients through often preventable non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs). The dedication of healthcare professionals to 
patiently communicate effectively underscored the patient‚Äôs quality 
of life. Overall, these experiences have allowed me to approach 
the medical profession holistically‚Äîfrom frontline care to tertiary services‚Äîproviding me with a 
more structured, realistic, and comprehensive understanding of the healthcare system, and more 
appreciation of medicine as a whole as my future career.

medications in Need and Interviewed by the Bangkok Post, 
Parliament Radio. (2022-Since)</h4>
    <p>
&emsp;As I have recognised the challenges faced by elderly NCD 
patients who must visit the HPHs monthly to collect their medication 
in bulk. I utilised my knowledge in the innovation competitions 
which led the development of the ‚Äò‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏°‚Äô project. Operating on 
a ‚Äòtake what you need, give what you can‚Äô model-like the ‚Äò‡∏ï‡∏π‡πâ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‚Äô 
of the Covid era, the project establishes stations with rails and boxes 
for reusable bags within HPH communities. This approach not 
only promotes the circular economy but also fosters community 
bonds, addressing both environmental sustainability and social 
support.<br>
      
&emsp;Through effective communication on my continuously updated Facebook 
page, I have successfully advocated for sustainable development, resulting in 
media coverage and increased community engagement. Since its inception in 
2022, the project has expanded to 4 service points at various HPHs in Nakhon 
Pathom and 2 drop-off points at Taksin and Rajavithi Hospital, demonstrating my 
commitment, organizational skills, and ability to scale initiatives.

    <h4 id="ELDERLY">First and Corresponding Author for the 
paper titled ‚ÄòUse of Social Media for 
Health Promotion among the Elderly in 
Thailand‚Äô (2023)</h4>
    <p>
&emsp;After witnessing the behaviour of the NCD 
patients at both the HPHs and the Hospitals from 
my shadowing and volunteerism, it had sparked my interest about 
Gerontology and other aspects of health. In relation to my online 
promotion of the ‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏° Project which targets the adults and elderly, I have done the study on the 
‚ÄòUse of Social Media for Health Promotion among the Elderly in Thailand‚Äô- which I found that 
social media could be an effective tool for health promotion. I was the first and corresponding 
author and presented it at an International Conference in Singapore. This had further developed 
my skills in research and oral presentation at an international level.

bacteria contamination of food utensils in the school canteen with the SI-2 test kit: A case study 
of a large high school in Bangkok‚Äô (2024)</h4>
    <p>
&emsp;As I became more interested at home, I decided to investigate our school's food safety and sanitation 
conditions, particularly focusing on coliform bacteria contamination in food contact utensils. Our 
findings revealed that the general eating areas and food preparation sections met high sanitation 
standards while those for containers, equipment, 
and waste management were inadequate and the 
coliform contamination of food utensils was 
observed. Our research team recommended the 
school as such and presented to the EPLUS 
International symposium at our school.
These experiences have not only sharpened my leadership, 
collaborating, planning, coordinating, analytical abilities, data 
management and my practice in empirical research but also 
fuelled my passion for evidence-based medicine and health 
advocacy.

    <h4 id="SLEEP"></h4>
    <p>
&emsp;Through my experience in research on gerontology and 
shadowing, I developed a keen interest in the study of sleep‚Äîa 
fundamental aspect that affects individuals across all age groups, 
including myself. Completing the course ‚ÄòSleep: Neurobiology, 
Medicine, and Society‚Äô from the University of Michigan has 
deepened my understanding of sleep and its role in overall health. It 
has also helped me adopt better sleep hygiene practices, reinforcing 
the connection between neurobiology and well-being. This course not only expanded my 
scientific knowledge but also strengthened my 
ability to apply academic learning to improve 
everyday life for practical medicine, as lifelong 
learning is the key for improving oneself‚Äôs 
quality of life as well as others.

&emsp;In addition, undertaking a CPR course in accordance with the

care, reinforcing my commitment to the comprehensiveness of medicine. This experience highlighted 
the need for coordination, teamwork, and effective communication, essential in high-pressure 
environments like emergency medicine. Together, these learning experiences have strengthened 
my dedication to becoming a well-rounded medical professional, prepared to apply both 
theoretical knowledge and practical skills to make a meaningful impact on patients' life.

      <h3 id="EXTRA">Extra-Cirlicular Activites</h3>
      <p>
&emsp;For my free time, I have participated in mini-marathons, and 
that near-death experience in Mongolia highlighted the significance 
of fitness in maintaining overall well-being. Whenever possible, I 
now make time for regular exercise to keep both my mental 
health and body healthy‚Äîessential demands of a profession like 
medicine. In the arts, learning to play the piano since a young age 
instilled in me patience and discipline. As an amateur poet, I express 
myself through traditional Thai poetry, which serves as a source of 
relaxation. I particularly enjoy composing Khlong (‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏á) poems for 
special occasions such as birthdays, New Year‚Äôs, and other holidays. 
Currently, I am honing my skills in the Chant (‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå) poetry style by 
writing a farewell poem for my school director.<br>
&emsp;In addition to that, I had the honour of winning first prize in 
a Japanese competition at my school, which focused on Japanese 
history and culture during Foreign Language Day 2023. This 
experience deepened my appreciation for other traditions and culture 
way of thinking which makes me able to empathize with and 
understand other people better.<br>
&emsp;One of the most important aspects which influence me 
greatly, having accompanied my parents to a Buddhist meditation 
with a monk from the Wat Pha in the Ban-Put-Montha, in Nakorn 
Nayok during the summer helps me to be mindful and more 
conscious of my actions. This activity makes me calmer in my 
actions toward others, which I hope to use the aspect of this 
philosophy toward my practice of medicine in the future.<br>
&emsp;These diverse experiences, from competing in cultural 
competitions to maintaining a regular fitness routine and exploring 
the arts, have contributed to a well-rounded development, preparing 
me for the multidisciplinary demands of a medical 
career. This is because I view medicine as just not 
science but integration with arts, and most 
importantly, humanity ‚Äì and I believe to use this 
aspect of mine as a student of medicine at the 
Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol 
University
