      <p>Yesterday, I was quite bored by online learning/tutoring. I had long for making myself a business card/namecard for myself for quite sometimes now (I don't like to keep digital contacts of others, I find it hard to do in general), thus I thought it was high time for making one.</p>
      <p>I first started with the "Modern Angle Business Cards" template by Microsoft Corporations on Word. However I find it to be too contemporary and without the pizazz that I want to communicate to others.</p>

      <p>Using Word is not my strong trait; most of the 6hrs spent is searching the web how to do something. I find that Bateman's Design is classy and is quite timeless. Along with my admiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_(film)">the movie and the fictional novel</a>, I choose this design as my inspiration.</p>
