    <h1>Creating My Own Business Card inspired by American Psycho's Patrick BATEMAN</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Yesterday, I was quite bored by online learning/tutoring. I had long for making myself a business card/namecard for myself for quite sometimes now (I don't like to keep digital contacts of others, I find it hard to do in general), thus I thought it was high time for making one.</p>
      <p>I first started with the "Modern Angle Business Cards" template by Microsoft Corporations on Word. However I find it to be too contemporary and without the pizazz that I want to communicate to others.</p>

      <p>Using Word is not my strong trait; most of the 6hrs spent is searching the web how to do something. I find that Bateman's Design is classy and is quite timeless. Along with my admiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_(film)">the movie and the fictional novel</a>, I choose this design as my inspiration.</p>

      <p>The final product of those 6 hours is displayed below.</p>
      <p>For the English Text, excluding my Name, I use Sigvar-Serial-ExtraLight, at size 7. And for the name I use the Sigvar-Regular, size 13. The "Sigvar" font choice is inspired by Singapore Airlines webpage.</p>
      <p>The Thai text is displayed in the royal font<a href="https://www.cra.ac.th/th/download_fonts">"Chulabhorn Likit Text Light"</a> which gives quite a glam and traditional-ish-ness to the overall design. It is also in the size 7.</p>

      <p>I finally print it with an Epson jet ink printer on a scored-textured cardstock.</p>
